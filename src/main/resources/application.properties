# --- JPA/Hibernate Settings ---
# This setting controls how the database schema (tables, columns) is managed by Hibernate.
#
# Options:
# - update: Hibernate updates the schema based on your entities. New tables/columns are added,
#           but existing ones are not deleted. Useful for development.
# - create: Drops existing tables and recreates them every time the application starts.
#           WARNING: All data will be lost on each restart! Only for development/testing.
# - create-drop: Same as 'create', but tables are dropped when the application stops.
#           Useful for testing.
# - none: Hibernate does not modify the database schema.
#           Typically used in production where schema changes are handled manually.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# Show SQL queries generated by Hibernate in the console (useful for debugging)
